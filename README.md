DeepBeliefSDK
=============

The SDK for Jetpac's iOS Deep Belief image recognition framework.

This is a compiled framework implementing the convolutional neural network architecture described by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton. The processing code has been highly optimized to run within the memory and processing constraints of iOS devices, and can analyze an image in under 300ms on an iPhone 5S. We're releasing this framework because we're excited by the power of this approach for general image recognition, especially when it can run locally on low-power devices.
